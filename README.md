# New Launcher

A new launcher powered by Flutter.
After trying some of the launchers, I found they're all lack of effectiveness.
So, I decided to make one own.

The ability new launcher can do:

- [x] Show time and greeting
- [x] Show weather (only by city name now)
- [x] Launch apps
- [ ] Launch useful intents
- [ ] Translate
- [ ] etc
